## WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES
* Helps with task management!
* *This is achieved in any of the following ways*
	* **register new users**
	* **add new tasks**
	* **view all tasks**
	* **view individual tasks**
	* **view statistics**
	* **generate reports**

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
In a basic summary, the program works by:
1. Having a player, enemies and a prize.

## DETAILED SUMMARY
### How is this done?
 Like any game, the objective is to reach a prize at the end of a section.
 This is done all while avoiding a number of enemies who attack from various directions.
 If the enemy makes contact with your player, the game ends and you lose.
 If you reach your target without any contact with the enemy, you win and the game ends,


1. Python
2. Pygame
3. IDLE
4. Notepad
5. Notepad++

# SETUP
    Open up a workspace in and IDE, I used VSCode, and import all the src files and press run.
